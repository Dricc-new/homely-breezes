# Homely Breezes
Welcome. This project is an example of a website for a hotel, it is just an example to demonstrate my frontend knowledge. The API that I am using is made with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), but I have not uploaded its code publicly, since it is not necessary. If you want to see this site in operation, visit this [page](#).

## Characteristics
The following technologies were mainly used
1. **[React]():** frontend framework.
2. **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/):** css framework. 
3. **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** frontend tooling.
4. **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** as a programming language.
5. **fetch**: do not use Axios because since it is a small project, using it would make the code very complex, and the idea is to make it clear and small.

## Final Notes

In case you want to test the project from local, clone the repository and once cloned follow the following steps.

**Step 1:** Execute the command `npm install` or `yarn install` (depending on your package management system) inside the clone folder to install the dependencies.

**Step 2:** Now run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the project in development mode.

**Step 3:** Open your browser and enter the address that appears in your console and press intro on your keyboard.
